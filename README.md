## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

`min-width: 0;`: This is important when using `flex-shrink`. For flex items and grid items, the minimum width value is either the specified suggested size, such as the value of the `width` property. Setting `min-width: 0;` overrides this, allowing the images to shrink below their intrinsic size when the flex container is too small.

How usefull `git show` if I want to check an older state of a file without checking it out. `git log` to find relevant state in commit history, then `git show c5987c05i329472eyf0d1cetffbd3611f994ceb5:path/to/file.html`
